This racing Yacht is called "MV35". It helps "MV36" racing Yacht when it's in
a race. Unlike the "MV36", it does not have a letter T on its sail, and it's
much smaller. It also has some things that are the same as the "MV36". The first
thing is its sails, the second thing is that it also has two parts that touch
water.
