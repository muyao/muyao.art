Zhong Kui (Chinese: 鍾馗) is a deity in Chinese mythology. Traditionally
regarded as a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings, and reputedly able to
command 80,000 demons, his image is often painted on household gates as
a guardian spirit, as well as in places of business where high-value goods are
involved. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Kui))
