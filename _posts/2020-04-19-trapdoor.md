This trapdoor is hidden in a castle because it protects a precious rock. If somebody goes into the castle, first the castle door 
and all the other doors will shut. Then there is only one way to go. So if the human goes onto the trapdoor, the trapdoor will 
fall down and the human will slide down into a secret dungeon.
