This Rubbish truck doesn't have a top part on its back. Once its back is full,
it will go to a Recycling station. To dump all the rubbish, its back will turn
90Â°. I almost gave up with the arm that pick up the bin because it was so hard
but I still made it.

This rubbish truck is picking up trash. These are the steps it picks up trash.
When a bin is full, the rubbish truck comes. Then the rubbish truck turns and
drives backwards with its rubbish picking arm pointing to the bin. When the bin
is between the 2 arms, the 2 arms will start lifting the bin until trash is
falling into the truck. When all the trash is on the truck, the truck will put
the bin back on the ground.
