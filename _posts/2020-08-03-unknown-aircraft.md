This aircraft is unknown. We say it is an alien space probe. It has splashed into the ocean in 2014. The hard thing to build it is that it is small. The most hard thing is its rocket booster. To attach it to the space probe, I need a 1x2 brick with side studs. Then I need a 2x2 round brick with cross axl hole. Then I put a wheel on the 2x2 round brick with cross axl hole.
